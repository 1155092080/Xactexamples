General function to vary a Lagrangian


[`Angular-integration.nb`](../../raw/master/Angular-integration.nb):
Example of angular integration on multiple direction vectors (adapted from Post-Newtonian computations)


[`Bianchi_I_xCoba.nb`](../../raw/master/Bianchi_I_xCoba.nb):
Bianchi I Einstein equation using the CTensor framework of xCoba

Clifford algebra construction in all integer dimensions and fast evaluations of traces of products of Dirac matrices.
The tracing function is applied to weak-interaction reaction rates.

[`ConformalEinsteinEqs.nb`](../../raw/master/ConformalEinsteinEqs.nb):
Implementation of the Friedrich's conformal field equations in dimension 4 
(metric equations and extended equations). 


[`Conformal_Transformation.nb`](../../raw/master/Conformal_Transformation.nb):
Tools to perform conformal transformations and examples. Adapted from a subpart of xPand's code.


[`EB-decomp-and-3+1-split.nb`](../../raw/master/EB-decomp-and-3+1-split.nb):
Examples of 3+1 decomposition applied to the Weyl tensor


[`EDGB-and-DCS-EOMs-and-C-tensors-simplified.nb`](../../raw/master/EDGB-and-DCS-EOMs-and-C-tensors-simplified.nb):
Getting equations of motion and simplifying "C-tensors" for Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet and dynamical Chern-Simons theories


[`FriedmannLemaitreMetric_CoordinatesApproach_xCoba.nb`](../../raw/master/FriedmannLemaitreMetric_CoordinatesApproach_xCoba.nb):
It shows how to define charts and specify the components of the metric so as to obtain the components of the related curvature tensors. Shows also how to change between different charts. Applied to homogeneous cosmology.


[`Gamma matrices (Dirac algebra).nb`](../../raw/master/Gamma%20matrices%20(Dirac%20algebra).nb):
How to treat the algebra of gamma matrices with DefProduct, and canonicalize them to derive many standard identities.


[`Lagrangian-variation-xPert-VarD.nb`](../../raw/master/Lagrangian-variation-xPert-VarD.nb):
A common usage pattern for varying a Lagrangian with respect to the metric to get Einstein equations


[`Raychaudhuri.nb`](../../raw/master/Raychaudhuri.nb):
Follows section 9.2 of Wald's book (General Relativity) on the Raychaudhuri equation for a congruence of timelike geodesics


[`SymManipulatorLovelockExample.nb`](../../raw/master/SymManipulatorLovelockExample.nb):
Application of the Spinors and SymManipulator package to show the Lovelock tensor is non-dynamical.


[`Schwarzschild_Metric_Birkhoff_Theorem.nb`](../../raw/master/Schwarzschild_Metric_Birkhoff_Theorem.nb):
Construction of the Schwarzschild metric. 
Eddington Finkelstein coordinates and surface gravity as simple applications of the CTensor tools of xCoba.


[`TimelikeCongruence.nb`](../../raw/master/TimelikeCongruence.nb):
1+3 decomposition of the Ricci and Bianchi identities in dimension 4 with respect to an 
arbitrary unit timelike vector field. The kinematical quantities and the spatial parts of the Riemann
tensor are used to obtain the decompositions.


[`Warped-product.nb`](../../raw/master/Warped-product.nb):
Minimal example 1) creating a warped product geometry and 2) breaking down the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian into the effective lower-dimensional Lagrangian.
